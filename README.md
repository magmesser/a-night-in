# A Night In

## User Story:

    AS A host
    I WANT to be provided with options for a meal and a movie in one location
    So THAT I can host a fun night in without the stress of decision-making.
    
## Description

For our group project we wanted to provide an application that would assist in choosing movie and dinner for a fun night at home. We found the shared problem in our personal lives of determining what to cook for dinner and what to watch when spending time at home with a loved one, family gathering, or group of friends. We wanted to provide an interactive application for users to provide a meal keyword and movie genre. The user can select their own inputs or they can let the application chose for them.  The user can then save their favorite options to use again. We hope that this application streamlines the decision making process for users to have a stress-free night in.
